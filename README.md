Phishing Website Detection by Machine Learning Techniques

Phishing websites are fraudulent web pages designed to deceive users into revealing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and financial details. With the rapid growth of online services, phishing attacks have become more frequent and sophisticated, making traditional blacklist-based detection methods insufficient.

This project focuses on detecting phishing websites using machine learning techniques by analyzing various features extracted from URLs, website content, and domain information. Instead of relying solely on manually maintained blacklists, the proposed system learns patterns that distinguish legitimate websites from phishing ones.

Key features used for detection may include URL length, presence of special characters, use of IP addresses instead of domain names, SSL certificate information, domain age, redirection behavior, and HTML/JavaScript characteristics. These features are fed into machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Naïve Bayes to build predictive models.

The trained models classify websites as either phishing or legitimate based on learned patterns. Performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Experimental results demonstrate that machine learning-based approaches can effectively detect phishing websites with high accuracy and adaptability to new attack patterns.

This system enhances online security by providing an automated, scalable, and intelligent solution for early phishing detection, helping protect users from cyber fraud and identity theft.
